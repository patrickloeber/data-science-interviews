## Supervised machine learning

**What is supervised machine learning? 👶**

A case when we have both features (the matrix X) and the labels (the vector y)

<br/>

## Linear regression

**What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem? 👶**

Regression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models predict a real number

<br/>

**What is linear regression? When do we use it? 👶**

Linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).

With a simple equation:

```
y = B0 + B1*x1 + ... + Bn * xN
```

B is regression coefficients, x values are the independent (explanatory) variables and y is dependent variable.

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

Simple linear regression:

```
y = B0 + B1*x1
```

Multiple linear regression:

```
y = B0 + B1*x1 + ... + Bn * xN
```

**What’s the normal distribution? Why do we care about it? 👶**

A normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data points near the mean are more frequent in occurrences than data far away from the mean. When plotted in a graph, normal distribution appears as a bell curve.

Some properties of normal distribution:

- Symmetric about the center
- The mean, mode, median all have the same value
- Half of the data values are distributed to left part of the center and the other half is distributed to the right side of the center.

The normal distribution can be used to describe many natural phenomena happening around us such as blood pressure, heights, and weights, standardized test scores such as SAT, GRE, and so on. For example, The standard normal distribution can help a student figure out how well she is doing on a certain subject relative to her peers. For instance, if her score is higher than the mean score, she might think she is doing good in that particular subject and the opposite is true too. To draw a more clear picture, a standard deviation is used to determine how far spread the data is. For instance, if she gets 80% in Chemistry and 93% in History, she might assume she is better in History than in Chemistry. But since Chemistry is a difficult subject, most of the students scored under
75%. And since History is an easier subject, the mean score on History was 92%. From the above analysis, it can be inferred that she did far better in Chemistry compared to her peers than she did in History.

## Validation

**What is overfitting? 👶**

When your model perform very well on your training set but can't generalize the test set, because it adjusted a lot to the training set.

<br/>

**How to validate your models? 👶**

Answer here

<br/>

**Why do we need to split our data into three parts: train, validation, and test? 👶**

The training set is used to fit the model, i.e. to train the model with the data. The validation set is then used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model while fine-tuning hyperparameters. This improves the generalization of the model. Finally, a test data set which the model has never "seen" before should be used for the final evaluation of the model. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model. The evaluation should never be performed on the same data that is used for training. Otherwise the model performance would not be representative.

<br/>

**Can you explain how cross-validation works? 👶**

Cross-validation is the process to separate your total training set into two subsets: training and validation set, and evaluate your model to choose the hyperparameters. But you do this process iteratively, selecting differents training and validation set, in order to reduce the bias that you would have by selecting only one validation set.

Answer here

<br/>

**How do we evaluate classification models? 👶**

Answer here

<br/>

**What is accuracy? 👶**

Accuracy is a metric for evaluating classification models. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions.

<br/>

**Is accuracy always a good metric? 👶**

Accuracy is not a good performance metric when there is imbalance in the dataset. For example, in binary classification with 95% of A class and 5% of B class, prediction accuracy can be 95%. In case of imbalance dataset, we need to choose Precision, recall, or F1 Score depending on the problem we are trying to solve.

<br/>

**What is the confusion table? What are the cells in this table? 👶**

Confusion table (or confusion matrix) shows how many True positives (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) model has made.

|           |              |    Actual    |    Actual    |
| :-------: | :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
|           |              | Positive (1) | Negative (0) |
| Predicted | Positive (1) |      TP      |      FP      |
| Predicted | Negative (0) |      FN      |      TN      |

- True Positives (TP): When the actual class of the observation is 1 (True) and the prediction is 1 (True)
- True Negative (TN): When the actual class of the observation is 0 (False) and the prediction is 0 (False)
- False Positive (FP): When the actual class of the observation is 0 (False) and the prediction is 1 (True)
- False Negative (FN): When the actual class of the observation is 1 (True) and the prediction is 0 (False)

Most of the performance metrics for classification models are based on the values of the confusion matrix.

<br/>

**What are precision, recall, and F1-score? 👶**

- Precision and recall are classification evaluation metrics:
- P = TP / (TP + FP) and R = TP / (TP + FN).
- Where TP is true positives, FP is false positives and FN is false negatives
- In both cases the score of 1 is the best: we get no false positives or false negatives and only true positives.
- F1 is a combination of both precision and recall in one score:
- F1 = 2 \* PR / (P + R).
- Max F score is 1 and min is 0, with 1 being the best.

Answer here

<br/>

**How do we use SGD (stochastic gradient descent) for training a neural net? ‍⭐️**

Answer here

<br/>

**What’s the learning rate? 👶**

The learning rate is an important hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem during the training. It can be seen as the "step width" during the parameter updates, i.e. how far the weights are moved into the direction of the minimum of our optimization problem.

<br/>

**What happens when the learning rate is too large? Too small? 👶**

A large learning rate can accelerate the training. However, it is possible that we "shoot" too far and miss the minimum of the function that we want to optimize, which will not result in the best solution. On the other hand, training with a small learning rate takes more time but it is possible to find a more precise minimum. The downside can be that the solution is stuck in a local minimum, and the weights won't update even if it is not the best possible global solution.

## Clustering

**What is unsupervised learning? 👶**

Unsupervised learning aims to detect paterns in data where no labels are given.

<br/>

**What is clustering? When do we need it? 👶**

Clustering algorithms group objects such that similar feature points are put into the same groups (clusters) and dissimilar feature points are put into different clusters.

<br/>

**Do you know how K-means works? ‍⭐️**

1. Partition points into k subsets.
2. Compute the seed points as the new centroids of the clusters of the current partitioning.
3. Assign each point to the cluster with the nearest seed point.
4. Go back to step 2 or stop when the assignment does not change.

<br/>

**How to select K for K-means? ‍⭐️**

- Domain knowledge, i.e. an expert knows the value of k
- Elbow method: compute the clusters for different values of k, for each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square, plot the sum according to the number of clusters and use the band as the number of clusters.
- Average silhouette method: compute the clusters for different values of k, for each k, calculate the average silhouette of observations, plot the silhouette according to the number of clusters and select the maximum as the number of clusters.

<br/>

**What are the other clustering algorithms do you know? ‍⭐️**

- k-medoids: Takes the most central point instead of the mean value as the center of the cluster. This makes it more robust to noise.
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC): hierarchical clusters combining the nearest clusters starting with each point as its own cluster.
- DIvisive ANAlysis Clustering (DIANA): hierarchical clustering starting with one cluster containing all points and splitting the clusters until each point describes its own cluster.
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN): Cluster defined as maximum set of density-connected points.

<br/>

**Do you know how DBScan works? ‍⭐️**

- Two input parameters epsilon (neighborhood radius) and minPts (minimum number of points in an epsilon-neighborhood)
- Cluster defined as maximum set of density-connected points.
- Points p_j and p_i are density-connected w.r.t. epsilon and minPts if there is a point o such that both, i and j are density-reachable from o w.r.t. epsilon and minPts.
- p_j is density-reachable from p_i w.r.t. epsilon, minPts if there is a chain of points p_i -> p_i+1 -> p_i+x = p_j such that p_i+x is directly density-reachable from p_i+x-1.
- p_j is a directly density-reachable point of the neighborhood of p_i if dist(p_i,p_j) <= epsilon.

<br/>

**When would you choose K-means and when DBScan? ‍⭐️**

- DBScan is more robust to noise.
- DBScan is better when the amount of clusters is difficult to guess.
- K-means has a lower complexity, i.e. it will be much faster, especially with a larger amount of points.
